Dr. Qurban happened to be the duty doctor in the ER when I took my wife the second time and i’d say we were so lucky that he was dealing our case because he was so quick in giving the right diagnosis and precisely knew the right treatment to deal with her critical situation.

Dr. Qurban also visited my wife and other patients in the family ward once they were stable. I must highlight here that generally doctors give a fixed time bound 5mins or less visit to each bed in family wards since the patients are generally in a stable condition. However, doctor Qurban would listen to his patients problems in detail without caring how much time it takes and would not move until his patient is satisfied and he has catered to all their queries. He is a great listener and has great command on his field. 

His ability to make quick aggressive decisions while staying calm under pressure, being polite, patient, respectful, sensitive to his patient’s needs, and being honest in his medical profession makes him a very competent and well-rounded doctor.

Wetzlar, Germany, Perfectly excellent. , Perfectly excellent. , The staff and Dr. Hanif Mugal are very friendly and helpful. I especially loved how Dr. Hanif Mugal really took his time to explain my conditions with me as well as my treatment options.

Not only has he taken great care of my health, but also he is lovely to speak with at every appointment. 
It’s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. 

In my opinion he is terrific. Knowledgeable, sensitive, informative & I immediately felt at ease – and felt confident in my receiving expert medical care.

So I highly recommend his homeopathy clinic as they provides one of the best homoeopathic treatments in Pakistan.

The doctor/patient relationship has been the central instrument of healing throughout the history of medicine. It is important in creating an empathic climate to be aware of one's own needs and boundaries during encounters with patients.
Most doctors currently don't even ask their patients what scares them and if they are anxious about their treatment and health outcomes. We need to make them more alive to the emotional reality of the medical contact.
My sister and mother went to have a thorough checkup to Dr. Somia Iqtadar’s clinic, and to be very honest without exaggeration, they were satisfied beyond their expectations. She is highly professional, competent, well experienced with a very polite, convincing and calm personality. She always put patient’s interests first. Extremely satisfying counseling by the worthy Dr and they have experienced an amazing improvement in their condition ever since they started visiting Dr. Somia Iqtadar. She listens like a friend, diagnosed like a true professional and treat like a well experienced doctor. She also gets in touch through mobile with her patients and at every visit she welcome with a polite smile on her face. Even she remembers her patient’s symptoms after a long time as she is very intelligent. Her emotional attachment with patients cured them more than a medicine. Now the situation is my mother and sister recommend her to every friend and family member as they believe in her and that’s the best thing about a doctor. I would highly suggest you to visit her for your medical concerns. 
She is just the best because medicine is not only her profession but also her passion!
 May Allah SWT bless her.

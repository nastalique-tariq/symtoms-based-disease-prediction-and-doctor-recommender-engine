# symtoms-based-disease-prediction-and-doctor-recommender-engine
This is a repository for my Final Year Project. 

This project is about Predicting the disease from the patient's symptoms and then recommend him a suitable doctor based on his personalized needs (the whole process will be automated)

Predicting the disease is the first step of our Project. It's a multiclass classification problem. We'll try various classification Algorithms and will choose the one with higher accuracy and other evaluation metrics as well depending on our needs.

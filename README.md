# symtoms-based-disease-prediction-and-doctor-recommender-engine
This is a repository for my Final Year Project. 

# Problem Statement
This project solves the problem of bad recommendations of doctors caused by Human errors and Human Biases. This project will predict the disease from the patient's symptoms and then recommend him a suitable doctor based on his personalized needs (the whole process will be automated)

# Dataset
I've uploaded the Datasets for symptoms. 
* This dataset has data of 42 diseases and their symptoms along with them as well. Refer to 'dataset.csv'
* If description of any disease is needed, refer to 'symptom_Description.csv'
* Precautions of every disease are also present in a separate dataset.

PLEASE NOTE: THESE DATASETS ARE FOR STEP 1 (PREDICTING THE DISEASE BASED ON SYMPTOMS)

Predicting the disease is the first step of our Project. It's a multiclass classification problem. We'll try various classification Algorithms and will choose the one with higher accuracy and other evaluation metrics as well depending on our needs.
